# CVE-2024-51328: Stored XSS in Travel Management System 1.0

Travel Management System version 1.0 by projectworlds has a Stored XSS (Cross-site-scripting) vulnerability in `addcategory.php` component. The `t2` parameter stores data directly from input
into the category table without any server-side sanitization. This results in execution of arbitary javascript code in other pages that loads the table such as `updatecategory.php`. 
 
## Proof-of-concept:

* Go to `addcategory.php` and save the payload `<script>alert(1)</script>` in the 'Category name' field.
* Hit the Save button.
* The alert box will get triggered on visiting `updatecategory.php`.


## Mitigation:
* Sanitize and validate all user inputs.
* Set HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite on cookies to prevent cookie theft.
